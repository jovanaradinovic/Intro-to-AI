# Intro-to-AI
First homework 
In a Latex file we have two 'theoretical questions' answered and the third question was to implement a simple reflex agent for the vacuum environment. Run the environment with this agent for all possible initial dirt configurations and agent locations. Record the performance score for each configuration and the overall average score. Extend the environment so to get differently shaped rooms, obstacles, dirt generation process, or other features you consider important.
